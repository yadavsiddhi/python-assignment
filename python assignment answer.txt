  1)  explain the key features of Python that make it a popular choice for programming?

ans)  Readability and Simplicity:- Python has a clear and easy-to-understand syntax which makes it an excellent language for beginners. Code written in Python is often                                    more readable than code written in other languages.

      Interpreted Language:-      Python is an interpreted language, meaning that it executes code line by line, which makes debugging easier and development faster.

      Dynamic Typing:-            In Python, you donâ€™t have to declare the type of a variable when you create one. The type is determined at runtime, which simplifies                                   code and makes it more flexible.

      Extensive Standard Library:- Python comes with a large standard library that supports many common programming tasks such as file handling, internet protocols,                                    string operations, and more.

      Cross-Platform:-            Python can run on various operating systems, including Windows, Mac, and Linux without requiring significant changes to the code.

      Versatile:-                 Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

      Community and Libraries:-   Python has a massive community and a vast array of third-party libraries, frameworks, and tools that extend its capabilities for web                                   development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more.


  2)  Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a program?

ans)   Definition:-   Predefined keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meaning and cannot be used as identifiers (names for variables, functions,                       etc.). They are integral to the syntax and structure of the language.

      Examples and Usage:-

                        if, elif, else: Used for conditional statements.

                                               b = 2.5
                                               c = a + b  # a is automatically converted to float
                                               print(c)  # 7.5

                 Explicit Type Casting:-   Manually converting one data type to another using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.

                                               python
                                               Copy code
                                               a = "123"
                                               b = int(a)  # Converts string to integer
                                               print(b)  # 123
                                               c = float(b)  # Converts integer to float
                                               print(c)  # 123.0
                                               d = str(c)  # Converts float to string
                                               print(d)  # "123.0"

                                               print(i)
                                         i += 1
                     # Output: 0 1 2 3 4
                                         Use Case: When the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on a condition.

         Nested Loops:-    Loops inside another loop.

                                         python
